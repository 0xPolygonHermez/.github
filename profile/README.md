**Zisk** is an open-source zero-knowledge proving system featuring a zkVM that enables verifiable execution of programs written in high-level languages like Rust.

Initially incubated by **Polygon Labs** from May 2024 to June 2025, Zisk became an independent project on **June 13, 2025**, with its intellectual property and core team transferred to **SilentSig Switzerland GmbH**, a company fully owned by **Jordi Baylina (@jbaylina)**.

The team remains dedicated to advancing Zisk as a **community-driven, open-source project** (under MIT/Apache 2.0 licenses), ensuring continuous improvement and maintenance.

We invite all **developers and projects** to test, contribute to, and use Zisk. Our goal is to build **the best zkVM project** in the space.
