ZisK is an innovative and high-performance zkVM (Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine) developed by Polygon that enables trustless, verifiable computation, allowing developers to generate and verify proofs for arbitrary program execution efficiently.

ZisK aims to provide a flexible and developer-friendly zkVM, with Rust as its primary language for writing provable programs, with planned support for other languages in the future. By abstracting complex zero-knowledge proof generation, ZisK simplifies the integration of ZK technology into scalable, private, and secure applications across blockchain ecosystems and beyond.

## Acknowledgements

ZisK is a collaborative effort made possible by the contributions of researchers, engineers, and developers dedicated to advancing zero-knowledge technology.

We extend our gratitude to the [Polygon zkEVM](https://github.com/0xpolygonhermez) and [Plonky3](https://github.com/Plonky3/Plonky3) teams for their foundational work in zero-knowledge proving systems, as well as to the [RISC-V](https://github.com/riscv) community for providing a robust architecture that enables the zkVM model.

Additionally, we acknowledge the efforts of the open-source cryptography and ZK research communities, whose insights and contributions continue to shape the evolution of efficient and scalable zero-knowledge technologies.

ðŸš€ Special thanks to all contributors who have helped develop, refine, and improve ZisK!
