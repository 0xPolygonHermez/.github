**ZisK** is an open-source zero-knowledge **proving toolstack** featuring a zkVM that enables verifiable execution of programs written in high-level languages like Rust.

- ZisK is **low-latency** by design, **distributed** by nature.
- ZisK **controls the entire in-house full stack**, enabling numerous **optimizations** that enhance the overall architecture.
- Targeting **128 bits security**.
- ZisK is the **Fully Open Source** (including GPU code) project. You can integrate in your own infrastructure.
- **RiscV 64 bit** architecture. Rust, golang, C#, etc.
- ZisK stack is **modular** and can allow other VMs like wasm or native LLVM

## History

Initially incubated by **Polygon Labs** from May 2024 to June 2025, ZisK became an independent project on **June 13, 2025**. Its intellectual property, the core team and all its knowledge were transferred to **SilentSig Switzerland GmbH**, a company fully owned by **Jordi Baylina ([@jbaylina](https://x.com/jbaylina))**.

## Development

The team remains fully committed to advancing ZisK as a **community-driven, open-source project** (under MIT/Apache 2.0 licenses), ensuring continuous improvement and maintenance.

We invite all **developers and projects** to test, contribute to, and use ZisK. Our goal is to build **the reference zkVM project** in the space.
