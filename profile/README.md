Zisk is an open-source zero-knowledge proving system. It includes a zkVM that enables proving the execution of programs written in Rust.

Zisk was incubated by Polygon Labs from May 2024 to June 2025. On June 13, 2025, the project was spun out of Polygon. The IP and core team of Zisk were transferred to SilentSig Switzerland GmbH, a company fully owned by Jordi Baylina @jbaylina.

The team is committed to continuously improving the project, maintaining it, and keeping it open source under the MIT/Apache license.

We invite all developers and projects to test, contribute to, and use Zisk. Our goal is to build the best zkVM project in the space.

To get started, check out the Getting Started Documentation.
